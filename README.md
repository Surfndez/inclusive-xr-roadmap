# Inclusive Design for Immersive Web Roadmap

The issues in this repository are used to help track follow up work from the [Inclusive Design for Immersive Web Standards Workshop](https://www.w3.org/2019/08/inclusive-xr-workshop/) help in November 2019.

As of Feb 5 2020, the issues are draft proposals derived from the [workshop report](https://www.w3.org/2019/08/inclusive-xr-workshop/report.html). We expect the newly proposed Inclusive Design for Immersive Web Community Group to further develop, maintain and track progress on these issues.
